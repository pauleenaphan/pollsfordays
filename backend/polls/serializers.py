# Serializers: 
# Used to convert complex data types into native python data types
# Handles incoming data and validates it
# You need a serializer for each model

# Representation:
# Refers to the process of converting complex python objects to data structure

# self: allows method to access attributes of the instance of the class
# super(): use method from parent class
# to_representation: takes data and converts it into a format that is sent to user
